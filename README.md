# Form validation

## Connecting the user experience to the service.

## Description

Forms serve the role of connecting the user to the service through a solid user experience. This is the place where the user interacts with a service, doing anything from simply inputting a name to register for the service, to setting up a order or making larger changes to an account.

## What is this?

During The Odin Project curriculum, I am going to be working on forms, expanding upon it as I learn more.

For now it is a simple one, using mainly HTMLS built in form type-checkers, but in the future I want to create a solid validation/security solution for the form, as practice.
